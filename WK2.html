      <div class="question">
        How is Ayn Rand’s philosophy still relevant today?
      </div>

    <p> "My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute."</p>
    <p>Ayn Rand’s philosophy of Objectivism preached rational individualism. It goes against the current political capitalist system where we are taught that "Selfishness is evil; sacrifice for the needs of others is good." Rand’s philosophy says that selfishness, rather than being evil, is a virtue. By this she did not mean exploiting others. Selfishness — that is, concern with one's genuine, long-range interest — she wrote, required a man to think, to produce, and to prosper by trading with others voluntarily to mutual benefit.</p>
    <p>Rand noted that only an ethic of rational selfishness can justify the pursuit of profit that is the basis of capitalism — and that so long as self-interest is tainted by moral suspicion, the profit motive will continue to take the rap for every imaginable (or imagined) social ill and economic disaster. Just look how our present crisis has been attributed to the free market instead of government intervention — and how proposed solutions inevitably involve yet more government intervention to rein in the pursuit of self-interest.</p>
    <p>Rand offered and entirely new system, to fight for a morality of rational self-interest, and for capitalism, the system which is its expression. And that is the source of her relevance today. Separating from her philosophy, Rand’s relevance today is that she identified with many people in her stories, causing them to rethink their values and themselves.</p>
