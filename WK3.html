        Week 3: Laura Owens at the Geffen
      </div>

      <div class="question">How is Owen's work different form other work that came before it?
      </div>

    <p>I attended the Geffen over the weekend to look at Laura Owens’ flavoursome exhibition, featuring around 60 of her latest pieces. What interested me about the exhibition was that each artwork was almost entirely different to the next. The style, materials, technique, etc. were individual to each painting. What was more interesting is the amount of different crafts inserted into one piece of art. Owens has been an innovative artist for years, setting a unique form of work in the industry. I think that her work is different from others that came before it because it remodelled what people thought could be included in a painting. She asked the fundamental question of, “What is a painting?” and transformed painting from there. Her approach to creation is a bit like Frankenstein, taking pieces of work from all mediums (collage, charcoal, oil paint, textiles, etc.) to make a new monster. But what truly makes her work unique is that the inspiration in her creation is from her own collection of experiences. Her work can never be appropriated because the subject in her works is her life.</p>
