      <div class="question">Do you think humans can be understood through cybernetics?
      </div>

      <p>All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace is another very interesting film by Adam Curtis that journeys through the idea of cybernetics. Throughout the film, cybernetics is put into context in terms of nature, machines, and human society. From what I gathered, cybernetics is the idea that everything in the universe can be fundamentally broken down into a system of networks maintaining natural order. Each and every part of a system equally contributes to an overall strong network. This was mentioned in the film through the theory and evidence of ecosystems; all things working together like a machine to create an even flow of energy and balance.

      <p>ACybernetic theorists thought that if nature and machines work in a network of equal parts, then so should humans and society. This meant that instead of being in charge of our own destiny, humans are controlled by a system of networks working towards equilibrium. Essentially, we are machines. While thinking about this idea, I liked the dream of a societal system without an authoritative power and politics. Everyone being equal parts to a connected system is a cool idea. But at the same time, I would assume that the world would collapse without power. Humans are much more intelligent than any other animal, we have ambitions and desires beyond survival. Breaking down the human mind and human society into predictable models of stabilizing networks doesn’t seem feasible to me. I believe that the world would spiral into chaos if cybernetic theories were to be applied to society. So to answer the question, no I don’t believe that human be understood or predicted through cybernetics.
