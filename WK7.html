        Week 5: Postscript on the Societies of Control Response
      </div>

      <div class="question">
        How does this text relate to Foucault's ideas on control?
      </div>

      <p>
        In the article Postscript on the Societies of Control the author, Gilles Deleuze, describes the way in which we are transcending through history in terms of our society. His argument takes similar views to that of Michel Foucault’s ideas of a shift from a disciplinary society to a society of control; rather than progressing through history, we are only transforming into new societies with similar undertones.
      </p>

      <p>
        Much like Foucault, Deleuze articulates that the rise of capitalism and the industrial revolution created a disciplinary society where there are institutions of discipline as well as forms of violence and manipulations of power that permeate oppressive agents, groups, and forms of government. One moves from one discipline to another (school, barracks, factory), contently remaining in a controlled environment.

      <p>
        In today’s society, we would assume that we have more “freedom.” We are no longer constrained by structures like schools or factories; we can take online classes or work from home. This seems like freedom, but Deleuze points out that this shift from a disciplinary society has moved into a society of control, where diffused information is still a method of controlling individuals and manipulations of power. While ‘freed’ from the enclosed environments of discipline, the demand diffuse into our lives all the time (answering emails, texts, etc). The continuous demand is drifting into our daily lives. Our society has shifted from a centralized surveillance point to a diffused matrix of information and algorithms. So while we have the notion to do ‘whatever we want,’ do we have more freedom than past societies?
