        Week 8: Pierre Huyghe Works Response
      </div>

      <div class="question">
        How is the work of Pierre Huyghe relational/systemic?
      </div>

      <p>
        Pierre Huyghe is a French Conceptual artist who explores philosophical notions with film and installation. Melding themes of pleasure and adventure with psychology, the artist creates situations that examine the boundary between reality and fantasy. Huyghe’s artistic work is far from conventional, as most is formless or outside a gallery due to it’s restrictive nature.

      <p>
        A visual artist, Pierre Huyghe has long been associated with relational aesthetics, having explored the relationship between reality and fiction, the issue of memory, of expeditions and exhibitions. A recipient of many awards, and having been exhibited in the most prestigious international cultural institutions, he is now investigating the complexity of organic life, which is a way of departing from the control of authorship to create the conditions for the emergence of a self-evolving work.
