        Week 10: Lyotard’s ‘Can thought go on without a body?’ Response
      </div>

      <div class="question">
        Can thought go on without a body?
      </div>

      <p>
        I found this text to be clear yet extremely hard to comprehend. The text begins with Lyotard explaining the future solar explosion, hence, a definite end to human and Earthly existence. He describes the complex incomplete understanding of a finite world or finite existence to humans as we are still living and have not yet experienced both sides. This leads the argument into questions of inhumane existence and its limits of matter, which then lead into the argument of ‘can thought exist without a body?’

      <p>
        In order for humans to exist after the solar explosion, we will have to re-create/leave behind ‘thought’ (or working software after the hardware has gone, as Lyotard defines it). However the make up of the human mind is based on many different potentialities and is more complex than computer coding. "It doesn't work with units of information (bits), but with intuitive, hypothetical configurations. It accepts imprecise, ambiguous data that don't seem to be selected according to pre established codes or readability. It doesn't neglect side effects or marginal aspects of a situation..." It is open to imprecise data via the elements of choice. This "openness" is what cannot be measured and is almost impossible to re-create. It is what sets human thought apart. So to answer the question of ‘can thought exist without a body?’ I would at present say definitely not.
