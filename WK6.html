        Week 5: Michel Foucault pt. I Response
      </div>

      <div class="question">How does the Panopticon play out in our contemporary lives?
      </div>

      <p>
        The podcast on the influence of French Philosopher and theorist, Michel Foucault, explains some challenging and thought-provoking concepts on power and its use on social control. What I particularly found interesting in the podcast was Foucault’s fascination with Jeremy Bentham’s Panopticon model. The Panopticon is “a building designed and laid out where a single guard, or a warden or anyone in a position of power can stand in a specific spot in the center…and THEY can see inside of the cell of any prisoner they want… but the prisoners can’t see them, they can’t know WHEN they’re being watched, they can’t know the criteria that determines WHY they’re being watched.” Bentham further explains that this system is designed to regulate behaviour as the only thing the prisoners can do is behave every second of every day as though they’re being watched…because they can never know when or when its not happening. Their lives become controlled by people in power, being moulded into good citizens. The panopticon is not just a building design, but also a system of control. Since designed in the eighteenth century, the panopticon has been used in prisons, schools, hospitals, workplaces, etc.

        In today’s society, and in our contemporary lives, the panopticon has manifested into digital culture. In the social media world, we are not simply exchanging mutual information; we are doing it with a crowd or audience. Therefore, whether we know it or not, our apparent self-expression or self-creation becomes tailored or suited to impress a particular audience. We are both guards and prisoners in a virtual panopticon world as we watch and judge one another’s shared content. Our activities are monitored and recorded by the social media services for market analysis and targeted advertising. Our online identity is moulded into the ideations of people in power through the need of recognition and affirmation (assuming we care about the consequences of our actions). So do we really have control of our online identity? This idea really caused me to think about how my thought process when sharing something online. What is most interesting is that this panopticon idea was designed way before the creation of the Internet, and yet it still very much applies to our digital lives.
