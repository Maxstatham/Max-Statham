    I'M AN L.A. BASED AUSTRALIAN ARTIST/ ATHLETE
    </div>

    <p>
      I am crazy. Iâ€™ve spent ten thousand hours pushing my physical abilities to their limits, chasing an uncatchable black line at the bottom of a pool.
      Being a student athlete at USC, I am constantly seeking balance. To balance my mind, the extremely unstimulating nature of my athletic passion has inherently cultivated my creative desire as an outlet.

      My life experiences and craving for new adventures have drawn me to a love of media arts. I love surrealist and photorealist art that explores many concepts of identity and society. Employing my own orignial thoughts and ideas, I highlight and comment on these concepts in most of my work. While I particularly work with mediums of traditional illustration and graphic design, I plan to explore a multitude of mixed mediums in the future. Take a look at my work and stay updated with my new creations!

      Enjoy exploring my mind.
