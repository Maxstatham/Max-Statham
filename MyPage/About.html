    I'M AN L.A. BASED AUSTRALIAN ARTIST/ ATHLETE

    <p>
      I am crazy. I’ve spent ten thousand hours pushing my physical abilities to their limits, chasing an uncatchable black line at the bottom of a pool. Everyday for 4 hours, I see nothing but the same black line; I hear nothing but the same sound of breaking water.

      While I love swimming’s ability to challenge me physically, its mentally numbing environment can drive me insane. Being a student athlete at USC, I am constantly seeking balance. To balance my mind, the unstimulating nature of my athletic passion has inherently cultivated my creative desire and imagination.

      My life experiences have drawn me to a love for surrealist art that explores many concepts of identity and society. While I particularly work with mediums of traditional illustration and graphic design, I aim to explore a multitude of mediums in the future. Take a look at my work and contact me if you have any questions! Enjoy exploring my mind.
