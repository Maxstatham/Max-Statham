        Week 9: Xenofeminism Manifesto Response
      </div>

      <div class="question">
        What are your thoughts on Xenofeminism?
      </div>

      <p>
        “Xenofeminism: A Politics for Alienation” is a multi-voiced manifesto authored by Laboria Cuboniks. The manifesto itself was super challenging to analyse. In part, it aligns itself with accelerationism, which imagines the end of capitalism through the deployment of its own means; the attempt to unify the political left. Similarly, Xenofeminism calls for using existing technology to re-engineer the world, while remaining cautious that “technology isn’t inherently progressive.”

        What I most understood about this manifesto was that it recognizes the violence inherent within technology; the good, the bad, the liberatory and the oppressive. It recognizes that this violence is something which can be harnessed. The violence of the machine. It is the recognition of alienation as a creative force. This left me to critically think about the truths being told.
