        Week 4: In Defense of the Poor Image Response
      </div>

      <div class="question">What is the political value of the poor image?
      </div>

      <p>In Hito Steyerlâ€™s chapter In Defense of the Poor Image he talks about the initial praise of the original, high-resolution image in the media industry. The obsession of this high-end image led to a niche community where authentic filmmakers would share their work underground and exclusively to avoid alteration and deterioration.  As the rise of the Internet flourished, these authentic works would be downloaded, compressed, ripped, etc. for high speed travel and world wide accessibility at the cost of its original clarity.</p>
      <p>As the Internet expended, the focus on the luxury original image shifted to the expression of reality and conditions of existence through fast paced poor image availability. The political value of the poor image is that the creation of the poor image sparked an abundance of accessible information. Secrets and opinions were no longer kept quiet and audiences became substantially larger. The more important value of these poor images is that as these images are downloaded, compressed, altered, appropriated, etc. in a continuous cycle, it touches the hands minds of a multitude of people. Through this exchange the poor image becomes a more united human reflection of own existence. It has the power to combine people and communities through mutual difference and agreement.</p>
