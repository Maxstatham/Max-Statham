      <div class="question">What is the difference between diagrams for art and non-art?
      </div>

    <p>After reading the blog on Shusaka Arakawa and Madeline Gins and their book <em>The Mechanism of Meaning</em> I was initially confused. One thing that I did understand was Marcel Duchamp’s interpretation of diagrams as a ‘visual language.’ Diagrams are a symbol or representation of information. It is intended to visually communicate such info. The thing that was confusing me was that Arakawa and Gins’ diagrams made no sense, so what info was it communicating? After reading again, I realised that many of their diagrams aren’t meant to make sense as they are intended to visually display Zen Buddhist ‘Koan’s’ (puzzles meant to confuse and jolt the mind into enlightenment) and challenge the viewer’s perception of subjectivity and objectivity. Diagrams for both art and non-art intend to visually communicate an idea. I think the difference between the two is that while non-art diagrams represent information in a logical manner, artistic diagrams can bend the rules and represent an idea and any form imaginable</p>
